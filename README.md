# BlissX

The main goal of BlissX is to make me learn how to implement a programming language.  

Other goals are :  
 - I want to have a syntax that is close to C++, because I like it and I hate script languages (JS, Python, ...)
 - I want the language to be easy used in C++ application (with focus on games)
 - I want the language to be 'fast' (As this is my first language I hope it will, but probably won't)
 
When I will have the time, I will add the next chapters that Robert Nystrom added.  
And also, I will add the specifications of the language below (But don't expect this soon).

When the book will be finished, first I'll probably buy it, and then I will go my own way for adding features and following my own syntax and techniques.
